# Vil Tools

## Overview

[Vil Tools](https://darakuneko.github.io/vil_tools/) is a collection of utilities for working with Vial apps layout files, commonly known as "VIL files."

### Features

- **VIL Copy Items**  
  This tool allows you to copy the VIL file items (such as macros, tap dances, combos, key overrides, and settings) to a new VIL file.   
  This means you can port your macros etc. to a new keyboard.   
- **VIL to Keymap.c**  
  This utility helps you generate a QMK `keymap.c` file based on the VIL file layout, making it easier to use with QMK firmware.
